    <h2 class="display-5">Tips for Increasing Muscle Mass</h2>
    <p>Building muscle mass requires a combination of appropriate nutrition, consistent resistance training, and adequate recovery. Here are some key points to help you on your journey:</p>

    <ul class="text-left">
        <li><strong>Protein Intake:</strong> Consuming adequate amounts of protein is crucial for muscle growth. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) recommends that 10-35% of your daily caloric intake should come from protein.</li>
        <li><strong>Resistance Training:</strong> Engaging in regular resistance training increases muscle protein synthesis, which is essential for muscle growth. This training should be maintained for at least six to eight weeks for noticeable results.</li>
        <li><strong>Protein Timing:</strong> Consuming protein before and after workouts can significantly enhance muscle protein synthesis. Whey protein, in particular, is effective due to its fast absorption rate.</li>
        <li><strong>Protein Sources:</strong> High-quality protein sources such as whey, soy, and casein have been shown to support muscle growth. Whey protein is especially beneficial for quick muscle recovery.</li>
        <li><strong>Balanced Diet:</strong> Including a variety of protein-rich foods in your diet can help you meet your protein needs. Foods such as chicken breast, tuna, eggs, milk, and Greek yogurt are excellent choices.</li>
    </ul>
